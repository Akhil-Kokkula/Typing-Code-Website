<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

<kbd>[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://www.typing-code.com)</kbd>

<p>Whenever I was typing code, my speed slowed down because of the syntax and use of special characters that I wasn't accustomed to in my everyday typing. So, Typing-Code.com was born. There are many benefits to typing fast. You can save DAYS per year by typing fast and you focus on what's important which is your creativity since you aren't distracted with how to type certain characters. <b>The ultimate productivity hack!</b></p>



### Built With
* <b>MongoDB Atlas</b>
  * Skills: CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations, trigger to save user stats of last 30 days, and Mongoose as ODM (Object Data Modeling) 

* <b>ExpressJS/NodeJS</b>
  * Skills: HTTP request methods, database models, and controllers

* <b>ReactJS</b>
  * Skills: custom hook for typing interface, frontend techniques for clean design, routing, and components

* <b>Firebase Auth</b>
  * Implemented sign up, login, and resetting password

* <b>Heroku Deployment</b>
  * Heroku CLI deployment



<!-- Features -->
## Features

The typing code websites that were available online did not have specific lesson plans for developing your typing skills in specific areas. I addressed this problem by including lesson plans for variable declaration and initialization, loops, classes, common algorithms, and real-world applications. Moreover, the websites online didn't save your typing stats to help see your progress and the typing interfaces were not user friendly. Take a look at how I addressed these problems in my website.    

<br/>

### Interactive Typing Interface

<kbd>[![Product Screen Shot][typing-interface]](https://example.com)</kbd>

<p>Focused, clean, and user-friendly typing interface. Users have the ability to correct prior mistakes and the clean design increases user focus.</p>

<br/>

### Progress Tracking

<kbd>[![Product Screen Shot][user-progress]]()</kbd>

<p>Display of your typing stats (wpm and accuracy) for the last 30 days. Also, the user chooses a daily time limit for practicing and the app tracks the user's daily time spent typing. </p>

<br/>

### Full Auth System with Firebase

  <kbd>[![Product Screen Shot][auth]]()</kbd>

<p>Sign up, login, and resetting password all implemented with Firebase authentication.</p>
